Racical phone has skin that feels your pinch 

https://www.fastcompany.com/90419364/this-radical-phone-has-skin-that-feels-your-pinch

![Image](skin.jpg)

This project is related to mine because this is one of the material and technology that can be used to build the robot car, such as it can sense the user action and react. It can sense pinch, pull, ticliing etc. Each action can be used to assign different function. This can save a lot of spaces for buttons and control unit. In my design, I might be able to achieve this by use the buttons or something simliar to the replicing project the fruit keyboard by turning other material to a button to make action to the micro bit.

UI lit by the light in your room 

https://www.fastcompany.com/90288239/an-apple-alum-just-invented-the-next-skeuomorphism

This project is related to mine because this is the technology that can be used in the interior design in the car. Sometime we might find ourseleves consistantly adjusting the light in and outside the car. With this technology, the light will adjust itself by the environment. I think I can put this in my design using the light sensor in the mirco bit to dim and lit up the light.

Interactive Mario Mushroom Block

https://www.hackster.io/sclandinin/interactive-mario-mushroom-block-2235dd

This project is related to mine because it used the acceleration sensor to activate an action. In my design concept, I want to use the acceleration sensor to trigger some action as well. Plus I can reference the use of the material since it look simple but effective and it is something I can build at home.

Change RGB LED Connected to ESP12E from Web Page Using Knob

https://iotmonk.com/courses/change-rgb-led-connected-esp12e-web-page-using-knob/

![Image](LED.jpg)

This project is related to mine because it is a new way to control the color of the light. In one of my design concept, I want the user to able to control the light by the information recieved from the sensor. He used node MCU as his control module which in my case, I can use the micro bit. This inspired me a different way to let the user to control it. It might not need to be the exact same method but this apperantly could be a way out.

WhatYouNeed( LED display base on data ) 

https://www.hackster.io/microBob/whatyouneed-

![Image](display.jpg)

This project is related to mine because the technique it used to display on a LCD pixel monitor base on different data could be included in my design. The mirco-bit has a small pixel display itself, I might not be able have a external screen like this project shown, however, the idea of display different things base on different condition could be used in my design. I probably have to discover more code for the mirco-bit to be able to do that.

Rocky Rover: Robotic Vision System PixyCam & Arduino 101

https://www.hackster.io/RONDAGDAG/rocky-rover-robotic-vision-system-pixycam-arduino-101-bd16f0

![Image](car.jpg)

This project is related to mine because this gives me an idea to build the model car. When building a model car, the hardest part would be making the chassis to have a appropriate size and function. It need to be strong enought to hold the wheel and others part that might need to be on it. So this project has gave me a great idea of how to build the car and the element that might be needed to make it look like a 'car'. 

## Other research ##

1. https://www.mantralabsglobal.com/blog/10-basic-principles-of-interaction-design/

This article is about the basic principles of interaction design. I used this principles to remind myself when I designing the final product. I found some of these principles very useful especially the affordability and functional minimalism. Sometimes I was a bit greddy and I want to put as much function in one design as I can but then it will be too complicated and messy, making it hard to use. So I learned to break it into different part and simplify the design. 

2. https://web.archive.org/web/20130602154034/http://interactionivrea.org/proxy/src.php?dest=en%2Fabout%2Finteractiondesign%2Findex.asp

This article summary the general idea of interactive design. From sofeware to hardware as well as services Only when these three things are harmony together make a good interactive design. It also pointed out the different with traditional design and why is it important in today society. The real needs and possibilities to improve human existence are the is the main point of interactive design. This also reminds me there is a lot more interactive design in our life than we thought. 

## Conceptual development ##

### Design intent ###
<!--- Include your design intent here. It should be about a 10 word phrase/sentence. --->
Improve the user experience of the car 
### Design ideation ###
<!--- Document your ideation process. This will include the design concepts presented for assessment 2. You can copy and paste that information here. --->

### Final design concept ###
<!--- This should be a description of your concept including its context, motivation, or other relevant information you used to decide on this concept. --->

### Interaction flowchart ###
<!--- Include an interaction flowchart of the interaction process in your project. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible. --->

## Process documentation ##
<!--- In this section, include text and images (and potentially links to video) that represent the development of your project including sources you've found (URLs and written references), choices you've made, sketches you've done, iterations completed, materials you've investigated, and code samples. Use the markdown reference for help in formatting the material.

This should have quite a lot of information! It will likely include most of the process documentation from assessment 2 which can be copied and pasted here.

Use subheadings to structure this information. See https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ for details of how to insert subheadings.

There will likely by a dozen or so images of the project under construction. The images should help explain why you've made the choices you've made as well as what you have done. --->

## Final code ##

<!--- Include here screenshots of the final code you used in the project if it is done with block coding. If you have used javascript, micropython, C, or other code, include it as text formatted as code using a series of three backticks ` before and after the code block. See https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ for more information about that formatting. --->

## Design process discussion ##
<!--- Discuss your process used in this project, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process. --->


## Reflection ##

<!--- Describe the parts of your project you felt were most successful and the parts that could have done with improvement, whether in terms of outcome, process, or understanding.

What techniques, approaches, skills, or information did you find useful from other sources (such as the related projects you identified earlier)?

What parts of your project do you feel are novel? This is IMPORTANT to help justify a key component of the assessment rubric.

What might be an interesting extension of this project? In what other contexts might this project be used? --->
