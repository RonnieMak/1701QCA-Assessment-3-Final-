Racical phone has skin that feels your pinch 

https://www.fastcompany.com/90419364/this-radical-phone-has-skin-that-feels-your-pinch

![Image](skin.jpg)

This project is related to mine because this is one of the material and technology that can be used to build the robot car, such as it can sense the user action and react. It can sense pinch, pull, ticliing etc. Each action can be used to assign different function. This can save a lot of spaces for buttons and control unit. In my design, I might be able to achieve this by use the buttons or something simliar to the replicing project the fruit keyboard by turning other material to a button to make action to the micro bit.

UI lit by the light in your room 

https://www.fastcompany.com/90288239/an-apple-alum-just-invented-the-next-skeuomorphism

This project is related to mine because this is the technology that can be used in the interior design in the car. Sometime we might find ourseleves consistantly adjusting the light in and outside the car. With this technology, the light will adjust itself by the environment. I think I can put this in my design using the light sensor in the mirco bit to dim and lit up the light.

Interactive Mario Mushroom Block

https://www.hackster.io/sclandinin/interactive-mario-mushroom-block-2235dd

![Image](box.jpg)

This project is related to mine because it used the acceleration sensor to activate an action. In my design concept, I want to use the acceleration sensor to trigger some action as well. Plus I can reference the use of the material since it look simple but effective and it is something I can build at home.

Change RGB LED Connected to ESP12E from Web Page Using Knob

![Image](LED.jpg)

This project is related to mine because it is a new way to control the color of the light. In one of my design concept, I want the user to able to control the light by the information recieved from the sensor. He used node MCU as his control module which in my case, I can use the micro bit. This inspired me a different way to let the user to control it. It might not need to be the exact same method but this apperantly could be a way out.

WhatYouNeed( LED display base on data ) 

https://www.hackster.io/microBob/whatyouneed-

![Image](display.jpg)

This project is related to mine because the technique it used to display on a LCD pixel monitor base on different data could be included in my design. The mirco-bit has a small pixel display itself, I might not be able have a external screen like this project shown, however, the idea of display different things base on different condition could be used in my design. I probably have to discover more code for the mirco-bit to be able to do that.

Rocky Rover: Robotic Vision System PixyCam & Arduino 101

https://www.hackster.io/RONDAGDAG/rocky-rover-robotic-vision-system-pixycam-arduino-101-bd16f0

![Image](car.jpg)

This project is related to mine because this gives me an idea to build the model car. When building a model car, the hardest part would be making the chassis to have a appropriate size and function. It need to be strong enought to hold the wheel and others part that might need to be on it. So this project has gave me a great idea of how to build the car and the element that might be needed to make it look like a 'car'. 

## Other research ##

1. https://www.mantralabsglobal.com/blog/10-basic-principles-of-interaction-design/

This article is about the basic principles of interaction design. I used this principles to remind myself when I designing the final product. I found some of these principles very useful especially the affordability and functional minimalism. Sometimes I was a bit greddy and I want to put as much function in one design as I can but then it will be too complicated and messy, making it hard to use. So I learned to break it into different part and simplify the design. 

2. https://web.archive.org/web/20130602154034/http://interactionivrea.org/proxy/src.php?dest=en%2Fabout%2Finteractiondesign%2Findex.asp

This article summary the general idea of interactive design. From sofeware to hardware as well as services Only when these three things are harmony together make a good interactive design. It also pointed out the different with traditional design and why is it important in today society. The real needs and possibilities to improve human existence are the is the main point of interactive design. This also reminds me there is a lot more interactive design in our life than we thought. 

## Conceptual development ##

### Design intent ###
<!--- Include your design intent here. It should be about a 10 word phrase/sentence. --->
Improve the user experience of the car 
### Design ideation ###
<!--- Document your ideation process. This will include the design concepts presented for assessment 2. You can copy and paste that information here. --->
Warning alert to warn user to slow down their car, light change depending on the environment.

### Final design concept ###
<!--- This should be a description of your concept including its context, motivation, or other relevant information you used to decide on this concept. --->
Warning alert if the car going too fast since a lot of people are not paying attendion or falling a sleep and they didn't know how fast they are going, this design is going to help warning the driver and slow them down. Eventhough most of the morden car has automatic headlight feature, some people would still forget to active the function. So I decided to design a new feature that not only the light will light up when it is dark but also have something to indicate that such as the LCD display on the micro bit. 

### Interaction flowchart ###
<!--- Include an interaction flowchart of the interaction process in your project. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible. --->

## Process documentation ##
<!--- In this section, include text and images (and potentially links to video) that represent the development of your project including sources you've found (URLs and written references), choices you've made, sketches you've done, iterations completed, materials you've investigated, and code samples. Use the markdown reference for help in formatting the material.

This should have quite a lot of information! It will likely include most of the process documentation from assessment 2 which can be copied and pasted here.

Use subheadings to structure this information. See https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ for details of how to insert subheadings.

There will likely by a dozen or so images of the project under construction. The images should help explain why you've made the choices you've made as well as what you have done. --->

### Developing concept ###

The first concept I want to put in the design is using the light sensor to achieve some action. I know there is some simliar excisting design out there but for this one I want to do more than automaticlly turn the light on and off I want the user have a choice, by add the button function I will let the user the choice the color of the light they intended to turn on.

The photo shown some basic concept of the model car and the LED and seosor location.

https://youtu.be/TKhCr-dQMBY
This video show how the light level seosor works and after understanding it I am putting it in my design. 

### concept 2 ###

The second concept I want to put into the design is use the acceleration sensor to warn the user they are going too fast. Most of the accident on road is cause by the unwareness of the driver. It doesn't matter if the car is safe in emergency, the best way to prevent it is avoid the getting into danger situation. I want to make a warning sound using the buzzer, when the sensor sensed that the acceleration is over a certain number the buzzer will make a warning sound. Also considering to add more function to the model car toward the ultimate design.

The photo shown the buzzer and battery park location on the model car.

https://microbit-challenges.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/accelerometer.html

This link shown how the acclerometer work and I am going to learn how to use it and put it in the design. 

### concept 3 ###

So the third concept is to join the first two idea together and design how to build the model car using some simple and recycling material. In the ultimate product, I would use the material to build a simple model car to represent the real car. The model car itself doesn't really matter. The most important thing is the function and interaction that can be use on it.

This image shown the concept of joinning the two inital idea together and the components I am going to use. And the location of each element. However it could still be changed if things didn't work out.

### Physical experiment ###

![Image](code2.jpg)

This is the code for the second concpet, buzzer to make the warning sound

![Image](lighton.jpg)

This is the code for the first concept, display base on light level and allow user to select which color of light to turn.( no complete need improve)

![Image](trycode.jpg)
Trying different value on the code to see how they react

![Image](final2.jpg)

This is the sketch for the simple model build, using some very basic material and it is a very rough model

![Image](model3.jpg)

This is the physical model I build 

![Image](model2.jpg)

This is another angel of the model

![Image](model1.jpg)

I am considering use something else for the wheels since it doesn't look like it is gonna work with the cardboard.

Now I am testing the automatic light set up

The final physical set up before putting the micro bit on it

![Image](finalsetup.jpg)
This is the final physical set up before the final testing, so instead of 2 LED light I had one because I think one would be enough to demonstrate the function of it plus controling 2 LEDs is a bit beyond my ability.

Just before I am going to firm the video of the final outcome the accelerometer on my micro bit failed so I will have to do something else to show the function. 


![Image](change.jpg)
I use the button to simulate the condition of the accelerometer measure the amount of acceleration and trigger the warning so I can demonstrate all the function including in this project, and I will upload another video using the simulator to show the 

## Final code ##

<!--- Include here screenshots of the final code you used in the project if it is done with block coding. If you have used javascript, micropython, C, or other code, include it as text formatted as code using a series of three backticks ` before and after the code block. See https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ for more information about that formatting. --->

## Design process discussion ##
<!--- Discuss your process used in this project, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process. --->
Up to this point, I already developed the final concept toward the ultimate design. However, I found the difficulty of building the physical product. In the aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology I already been through the discover and define stage, and I am now at the develop stage. And facing the stuggle moving toward the deliver stage, the outcome at this point is not satisfy. The code is partly working but it is still didn't work the way I want it to be. More testing and building is needed for the success of the final design. Think back to the reseach I have done earlier, I overcome the functional minimalism problem I always has, I break it into small part and try to join them together in the final product. It makes the design less messy and the function I put in is real need. After the final design is completed, it actually let me understand how much work and experiment need to be done before the final outcome.

## Reflection ##

In the research I found, I learnt some new design principles such as affordability and functional minimalism. It actually helped me to develop a better in this assignment. As before reading the external article, I was thinking the way I always am, but in the field of design, being open minded is always the best way to improve. And of course, the ability and skills to use the micro bit is also a great experience as I can use the micro bit to help me to build something creative and interesting in the future. It is like unlocked a new path to creation. Those related project gives me an ideas of how much I can learn just by watching others design. And combine some of the idea in those design actually 

The parts that trying different code and testing different set up to see how it changes the micro bit work is something very new to me. Although I had experience in making web site and phone app, being able to see something thats intetact with real life is much more fun and motivated. 

The project can have some interesting extension such as: Increase the value of the acceleration and put it on two different remote car and see which one accelerate faster. This project can also be used in helping some learner driver to learn how to drive. Maybe just added a new acceleration measurement on horizontal. If the learner drive turning the corner too fast and it will trigger the alert to remind them to maintain the right speed when turning the corner.
